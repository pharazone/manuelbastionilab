LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

The AGPL can be an obstacle in case someone wants to create a closed 
source game or closed source 3D models using 3D characters made with 
the lab because the AGPL will propagate from the base models and from 
the database to the output models.

For this reason it was decided to consent a double license ONLY for 
the models generated by the official software*, NOT for the source code, 
NOT for the json database and NOT for blend files included in 
the distribution:

- The default license for models generated by the software 
  is AGPL 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html.

- Alternatively, for closed source games or closed source 3D models, 
  it's possible to choose, for characters generated by the official* software, 
  the Attribution 4.0 International, giving to Manuel Bastioni the credit 
  as required by that license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.
